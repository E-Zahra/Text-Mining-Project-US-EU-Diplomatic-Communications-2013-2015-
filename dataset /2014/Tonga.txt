<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>The Kingdom of Tonga is a constitutional monarchy. In 2012 King Siaosi Tupou VI succeeded his older brother to the throne following the former king’s death. The king, popularly elected parliamentary leaders, the nobility and their representatives, prominent commoners, and democratic reform figures dominated political life. The parliamentary elections in November were deemed generally free and fair, and in December parliament elected Samiuela ‘Akilisi Pohiva as prime minister. Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.</p>
<p>Domestic violence, discrimination against women, and government corruption were the most prevalent human rights problems.</p>
<p>The privileged status enjoyed by the royal family and nobility contributed to a lack of government transparency and socioeconomic mobility.</p>
<p>The government took steps to prosecute officials who committed abuses.</p>

<h2>a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>No cases of arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life were reported during the year. In April the Supreme Court convicted two police officers of manslaughter and a third police officer of assault in the 2012 death of a New Zealand police officer of Tongan descent. The man, detained for drunkenness, died following the assault in his cell. All three officers were serving sentences at year’s end. The court acquitted two other officers.</p>

<div class="sub-section section1bdisappearance">
<a class="goto" name="section1bdisappearance"></a>
<h2>b. Disappearance</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1ctorture">
<a class="goto" name="section1ctorture"></a>
<h2>c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits such practices, but there were complaints against police officers of violence and related misconduct. As of October citizens lodged 39 complaints against police officers, including two complaints of excessive force in the execution of official duties.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1prisonand">
<a class="goto" name="section1prisonand"></a>
<h2>Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>Prison and detention center conditions generally met international standards.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: As of July the country’s four prisons and other detention facilities held 176 inmates, including eight women. There were 17 juveniles and three prisoners with disabilities. Authorities held two nonviolent prisoners with disabilities at the Vaiola Hospital and one prisoner with disabilities in the Hu’atolitoli prison. The official prison capacity grew to between 300 and 400 inmates after the construction of two new facilities during the year. Authorities held pretrial detainees at police headquarters in Nuku’alofa and Hu’atolitoli prison. As of July there were 13 pretrial detainees at Hu’atolitoli prison. As of July 2013, 372 pretrial detainees (360 men and 12 women) were held at the police headquarters. During the year one death occurred in the Hu’atolitoli pretrial detention center due to natural causes (heart attack). Prisoners had access to potable water and sufficient quantities of food. Sanitation and medical care were adequate.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Authorities maintained a tracking system to ensure that prisoners were not held beyond the maximum sentence for their offense. Penal and judicial authorities did not use alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders. The country did not have an ombudsman to serve on behalf of prisoners and detainees. Prisoners had access to visitors and permission for religious observance. Authorities permitted prisoners to submit complaints without censorship to the prison custodial division, which then forwarded them to the commissioner of prisons for review and action. Prison officials also permitted prisoners to submit complaints to judicial authorities.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: At least once every quarter a group of three to five persons called “visiting officers” chosen by the cabinet and normally including a police magistrate, a physician, and a member of the clergy visited the prisons to hear any prisoner complaints or grievances. The government permitted monitoring visits by international human rights observers, but there were no such visits reported during the year.</p>

<a class="goto" name="section1darbitrary"></a>
<h2>d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observed these prohibitions.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Role of the Police and Security Apparatus</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The national police force, under the minister of police and prisons, maintains internal security. His Majesty’s Armed Forces (HMAF), under the minister of defense (a position held by the prime minister during the year), is responsible for external security. In emergency situations the HMAF also shares domestic security duties with the police. The king is the commander in chief of the HMAF. Civilian authorities maintained control over the HMAF and police, and the government has effective mechanisms to investigate and punish security force abuse and corruption. There were no reports of impunity involving the security forces during the year. Complaints against police are referred to the Police Employment Committee, which determines the severity of the complaint and refers it to the police board. The committee may take disciplinary action against police officers but refers serious breaches to the board. The board has the power to determine the action to be taken in response to a serious breach of discipline, including dismissal from the force. Entry-level police training included training on corruption, ethics, transparency, and human rights.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for the right to judicial determination of the legality of arrest, and this was observed during the year. Under normal circumstances police have the right to arrest detainees without a warrant, but they must bring detainees before a local magistrate or the officer in charge of the station within 24 hours. In most cases magistrates set bail. The constitution provides the right to initiate habeas corpus proceedings. The law does not specifically permit nor deny unlimited access by counsel and family members to detained persons, but authorities generally facilitated access. No legal aid framework existed during the year to provide services for the indigent. Accused persons may represent themselves if they cannot afford legal counsel.</p>

<div class="sub-section section1edenial">
<a class="goto" name="section1edenial"></a>
<h2>e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution provides for an independent and impartial judiciary but gives the lord chancellor, appointed by the king, responsibility for all matters related to the judiciary, including appointment, investigation, and removal of judges.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Trial Procedures</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution provides for the right to a fair trial, and the judiciary generally enforced this right. Although unavailability of judges, witnesses, or lawyers could delay cases, legal authorities processed most cases without undue delay. Trials are public, and defendants have the option to request a seven-member jury. Defendants are presumed innocent and cannot be compelled to testify or confess guilt. They are informed promptly and in detail of the charges against them, including free interpretation if necessary. They have access to government-held evidence and may present witnesses and evidence, confront witnesses against them, and appeal convictions. They have the right to be present at their trials, consult with an attorney in a timely manner, and have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense. Public defenders are not provided, but local lawyers occasionally took pro bono cases. The law extends these rights to all citizens without discrimination.</p>

<h2>a. Freedom of Speech and Press</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and in contrast with previous years, the government generally respected these rights. An independent press, the judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combined to promote freedom of speech and press. Both private and publicly owned media had access to parliamentary debates. The debate minutes were publicly available online within days of the debates.</p>
<p><u>Press Freedoms</u>: The independent media were active and expressed a wide variety of views without restriction, although some self-censorship occurred.</p>
<p><u>Censorship or Content Restrictions</u>: Media outlets reported on political developments and high-profile court cases but exercised self-censorship regarding high-profile individuals. The board of the Tonga Broadcasting Commission (TBC), a government-owned company, directed that board-appointed censors review all TBC programming prior to broadcast.</p>
<p><u>Libel Laws/National Security</u>: There were no libel judgments against media organizations initiated during the year. In June 2013 the court fined the <i>Kele’a</i> newspaper 250,000 pa’anga ($146,000) after it published an article entitled “The Law is Paralyzed when Dealing with the Leaders.” The <i>Kele’a </i>published a second article on the topic. The court fined the two editors 2,500 pa’anga ($1,463) in July 2013. On appeal, in April the judge reduced one editor’s sentence to 500 pa’anga ($293) and denied the second editor’s appeal.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Internet Freedom</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>There were no government restrictions on access to the internet or credible reports that the government monitored e-mail or internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority. Workplaces and internet cafes provided internet access, but most homes did not have such access. In August 2013 the country connected to a submarine cable system providing high-speed internet connections. According to the World Bank, 35 percent of citizens had access to the internet in 2013.</p>

<h2>d. Freedom of Movement, Internally Displaced Persons, Protection of Refugees, and Stateless Persons</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government generally respected these rights. The government cooperated with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in providing protection and assistance to refugees and other persons of concern.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Protection of Refugees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The country’s laws do not provide for the formal granting of asylum or refugee status. The principal immigration officer has wide discretionary powers under immigration laws, however, and may allow noncitizens to remain in the country. In 2013 officials worked with the international community and the UNHCR to provide assistance to a UNHCR-designated refugee in the country awaiting resettlement.</p>

</div><div class="sub-section section3electionsand">
<a class="goto" name="section3electionsand"></a>
<h2>Elections and Political Participation</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: Observers deemed the most recent parliamentary elections in November to be generally free and fair. Parliament has 26 elected members. Of these, citizens elect 17, and the 33 hereditary nobles elect nine of their peers. Parliament elects the prime minister, who appoints the cabinet. The prime minister may select up to four cabinet members from outside parliament, who are also seated in parliament during their tenure in the cabinet.</p>
<p>The king retains significant powers, such as withholding his assent to laws and dissolving parliament.</p>
<p><u>Political Parties and Political Participation</u>: Nobles and cabinet members associated with the royal family historically dominated parliament and the government. Over the last several decades, the number of seats held by elected members has increased and is now higher than the seats reserved for hereditary nobles. For the first time, in 2010 the prime minister was elected by members of parliament instead of being selected by the king. Since 2005 three reform-oriented political parties were registered. The most powerful party was the Democratic Party of the Friendly Isles. These parties continued to work towards a political system in which an increasing number of members of parliament are elected by the people, in relation to the number of seats reserved for the nobility.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: No women were elected to parliament. A woman may become queen, but the constitution forbids women from inheriting hereditary noble titles or becoming chiefs.</p>
<p>There were no members of minority ethnic groups in the government or parliament.</p>

<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>While the law provides criminal penalties for official corruption, the government did not implement the law effectively, and officials sometimes engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. There were some reports of government corruption during the year.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: In March the court convicted a senior immigration official of attempting to forge two passports and sentenced him to two years and six months in prison. Authorities investigated the immigration department following other allegations of improper issuances of diplomatic passports. The case continued at year’s end.</p>
<p>Bribery and other forms of corruption in the police force reportedly occurred. In January the court convicted a police officer of importing a controlled substance into the country and sentenced him to five years and four months in prison.</p>
<p>Government preferences appeared to benefit unfairly businesses associated with government officials, nobles, and the royal family. The royal family continued to exert significant influence over public finances.</p>
<p>The Office of the Auditor General reports directly to parliament. The Office of the Anti-Corruption Commissioner is empowered to investigate official corruption. Both entities actively collaborated with civil society, but they neither operated effectively or independently nor were sufficiently resourced.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: There is no law requiring income and asset disclosure by appointed and elected officials.</p>
<p><u>Public Access to Information</u>: The law does not specifically allow for public access to government information, and such access was a problem, especially when the government deemed the information sensitive. The Freedom of Information Policy, implemented by the Ministry of Information and Communication, gives persons the right to access some information on the roles and operations of each workplace in the public sector and to lodge a complaint to the commissioner of public relations if a government ministry refuses to disclose the requested information. Citizens exercised this right during the year.</p>

<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>Although the constitution prohibits general discrimination, the government did not effectively enforce this provision, and the law confirms the special status of members of the royal family and the nobility. While social, cultural, and economic facilities were available to all citizens regardless of race and religion, members of the hereditary nobility had substantial advantages, including control over most land and a generally privileged status.</p>
<p>The law provides for the unequal treatment of women.</p>
</div><div class="sub-section section6women">
<a class="goto" name="section6women"></a>
<h2>Women</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: Rape is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The law recognizes spousal rape. The incidence of rape appeared to be infrequent, although there were no reliable statistics. Police investigate reported rape cases, which are then prosecuted under the law. As of May police reported six rape cases. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) often report a higher incidence of rape than police reports. As of June the Women and Children Crisis Center reported eight rape cases.</p>
<p>The Family Protection Act, which came into force in July, makes domestic violence a crime punishable by up to 12 months in prison, a fine of 2,000 pa’anga ($1,171), or both. Repeat offenders face up to three years in prison or a maximum fine of 10,000 pa’anga ($5,853). The act provides for protection from domestic violence, introduces protection orders, clarifies the duties of police, and promotes the health, safety, and well-being of domestic violence victims. As of August police issued 16 protection orders under the act.</p>
<p>The police domestic violence unit has a “no-drop” policy in complaints of domestic assault--once filed, domestic violence cases cannot be dropped and proceed to prosecution in the magistrates’ courts. As of May the unit reported 130 cases. Following reports of abuse, the unit’s officers counseled victims. A male officer also counseled perpetrators. Police worked with the National Center for Women and Children as well as the Women and Children Crisis Center to provide shelter for abused women, and girls and boys under age 14. Both centers had a safe house for victims. The Free Wesleyan Church operated a hotline for women in trouble, and the Salvation Army provided counseling and rehabilitation programs.</p>
<p>In 2013 the police domestic violence unit, together with various NGOs, including the National Center for Women and Children, the Women and Children Crisis Center, and the Salvation Army, conducted public awareness and prevention campaigns against domestic violence. As of June statistics compiled by the Women and Children Crisis Center indicated that 103 persons, including 64 women, seven men, and 32 children, received assistance from the center during the year.</p>
<p><u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)</u>: The law prohibits FGM/C, and there were no reports of such practices.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: Sexual harassment is not a crime under the law, but physical sexual assault can be prosecuted as indecent assault. Sexual harassment within a domestic relationship is an offense. Complaints received by the police domestic violence unit indicated that sexual harassment of women sometimes occurred. As of June the Women and Children Crisis Center reported no cases of sexual harassment.</p>
<p><u>Reproductive Rights</u>: Couples and individuals have the right to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing, and timing of their children; to have the information and means to do so; and to attain the highest standard of reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion, and violence. Public hospitals, health centers, and several local and international NGOs provided free information about and access to contraception. Under a Ministry of Health policy, a woman is not permitted to undergo a tubal ligation at a public hospital without the consent of her husband or, in his absence, her male next of kin. Spousal consent is not required for men to undergo a vasectomy. Public hospitals and health centers provide free prenatal, obstetric, and postpartum care. Many pregnant women reportedly did not seek these services, and availability of these services was reduced in the outer islands. A high maternal mortality rate of 110 per 100,000 births was anecdotally attributable to this. According to data published by the World Health Organization, skilled health personnel attend 99 percent of births.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: Inheritance laws, especially those concerned with land, discriminate against women. Women can lease land, but inheritance rights pass through the male heirs only. Under the inheritance laws, the claim to a father’s estate by a male child born out of wedlock takes precedence over the claim of the deceased’s widow or daughter. If there are no male relatives, a widow is entitled to remain on her husband’s land as long as she does not remarry and remains celibate. Both the inheritance laws and the land rights laws increased economic discrimination that women experienced in terms of their ability to access credit, and own and operate businesses.</p>
<p>Women participated in the work force at a lower rate than that of their male counterparts (63 percent for men compared with 42 percent for women). As of 2003 (latest available data) average weekly earnings were higher for men: 127 pa’anga ($74) compared with 112 pa’anga ($66) for women (see section 7.d.). Women who rose to positions of leadership often had links with the nobility. Some female commoners held senior leadership positions in business and government, including as minister of education.</p>
<p>The Office of Women within the Ministry of Education, Women, and Culture is responsible for facilitating development projects for women and assisted women’s groups in setting up work programs.</p>
<p>The National Center for Women and Children and the Women and Children Crisis Center focused on domestic abuse and improving the economic and social conditions of women. Other NGOs, including Ma’a Fafine Moe Famili (For Women and Families, Inc.) and the Tonga National Women’s Congress, promoted human rights, focusing on the rights of women and children. Several religiously affiliated women’s groups also advocated for women’s legal rights.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Birth in the country does not confer citizenship. Citizenship is derived from one’s parents or from the citizen parent if only one parent is a citizen. The law requires births to be registered within three weeks, and this was usually done.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: As of May the police domestic violence unit reported 12 cases of physical assault on female children (up to age 20). There were six reported cases of assaults on male children. In May a court convicted three adults in the 2013 killing of a female child and sentenced the perpetrators to 13, nine, and two years in prison.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: The legal minimum age of marriage is 15, and the rate of marriage for children under the age of 18, while not known, was believed to be low.</p>
<p><u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)</u>: The law prohibits FGM/C, and there were no reports of such practices.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: The minimum age for consensual sex is 16 years. Violators may be charged with “carnal knowledge of a child under age 12,” which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, or “carnal knowledge of a child under 15,” which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The law prohibits child pornography with penalties of a fine of up to 100,000 pa’anga ($58,500) or up to 10 years in prison for individuals and a fine of up to 250,000 pa’anga ($146,000) for corporations. There were anecdotal reports of children being subjected to domestic sex trafficking.</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.</p>

<h2>Persons with Disabilities</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>No laws specifically prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, and there are no legally mandated provisions for services for them. There were no programs to ensure access to buildings for persons with disabilities, and most buildings were not accessible. There also were no programs to ensure access to communications and information for persons with disabilities. The Tonga Red Cross Society (TRCS) operated a school for children with disabilities and conducted occasional home visits. A program of the Ministry of Education, Women, and Culture to assimilate children with disabilities into primary schools continued during the year. Many school buildings, however, were not accessible to students with physical disabilities, and attendance rates of children with disabilities at all educational levels were lower than those of students without disabilities. It was possible for some children with disabilities to attend regular schools, depending on the nature and degree of the child’s disability, but children with more severe disabilities generally attended the TRCS-run school.</p>
<p>In May the cabinet adopted the National Policy on Disability Inclusive Development 2014 to 2018 and the Action Plan for the National Policy on Disability Inclusive Development. Under the policy the government established a National Council on Disability and designated the Ministry of Internal Affairs to work on disability-related problems.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of Commerce, Tourism, and Labor, the law restricts to citizens ownership and operation of food retail stores in the country.

<h2>Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>By law “sodomy with another person” is a crime with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, but there were no reports of prosecutions under this provision for consensual sexual conduct between adults, regardless of the gender of the parties. No laws specifically prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity or address hate crimes. No criminal justice mechanisms exist to aid in the prosecution of bias-motivated crimes against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. Society accepted a subculture of transgender dress and behavior, and a prominent NGO’s annual festival highlighted transgender identities. There were no reports of violence against persons based on sexual orientation or gender identity, but social stigma or intimidation may have prevented incidents of discrimination or violence from being reported.</p>

<h2>a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The country has no formal labor code. The law provides for the right to form unions, but the government has not promulgated regulations on the formation of unions, collective bargaining, or the right to strike, and no unions existed. No law specifically prohibits antiunion discrimination or provides for reinstatement of workers fired for union activity.</p>
<p>There was no dispute resolution mechanism in place specifically for labor disputes, although persons could take their cases to court.</p>
<p>There were no formally registered unions, although a number of workers’ organizations existed. The Friendly Islands Teachers Association and the Tonga Nurses Association were legally incorporated as civil societies, while the Friendly Island Seafarer’s Union Incorporated was affiliated with the International Transport Workers Federation. None has formal bargaining rights under the law. The Public Service Association acted as a de facto union representing all government employees. Collective bargaining was not known to take place. There have been strikes in the past, but none took place during the year. There were no known reports of antiunion or antiassociation discrimination during the year.</p>

<h2>b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and for human trafficking, including forced labor, prescribes up to 20 years imprisonment, which is generally considered sufficient to deter violations. Although the government made some progress in enforcing relevant legal provisions, no data were available on government efforts specifically to address forced labor. There were some anecdotal reports of forced labor among women and children in domestic service (also see section 7.c.).</p>

<h2>c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>No legislation prohibits child labor or specifies a minimum age for employment. There were no reports that child labor existed in the formal wage economy. According to the National Center for Women and Children and other NGOs, some school-age children worked in the informal sector in traditional family activities such as subsistence farming and fishing. There were also reports that some children were subjected to commercial sexual exploitation (see section 6, Children) and involuntary domestic servitude.</p>

<h2>d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment or Occupation</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law does not prohibit discrimination regarding race, sex, gender, disability, language, sexual orientation, gender identity, HIV-positive status or other communicable diseases, or social status. Discrimination with respect to employment and wages occurred with respect to women (see section 6, Women). Reports indicated that discrimination against foreign domestic workers occurred during the year. Some employers reportedly confiscated foreign domestic workers’ passports and subjected the workers to exploitative practices.</p>

<div class="sub-section section7eacceptable">
<a class="goto" name="section7eacceptable"></a>
<h2>e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There is no minimum wage law, although the Ministry of Commerce, Tourism, and Labor set guidelines for wage levels. Data from the 2009 household income and expenditure survey (the latest available) indicated that 3.1 percent of the population lived in absolute poverty and 22.5 percent lived below the basic needs poverty line. While the latter group did not live in absolute poverty, they struggled to meet costs such as education, transport, and utility bills.</p>
<p>Labor regulations limit the workweek to 40 hours. No laws mandate premium pay for overtime or prohibit excessive compulsory overtime. Government employees were either paid for overtime if overtime claims fell within their employing ministry’s budget, or granted compensatory annual leave. Heads of government departments have the discretion to approve annual leave once a government employee has worked for one calendar year. Government employees are entitled to paid annual holidays.</p>
<p>The law stipulates specific occupational health and safety standards for each sector, such as fisheries and agriculture.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Commerce, Tourism, and Labor is responsible for enforcing labor laws and regulations in the wage sector of the economy, but with only five officers in the ministry, enforcement of regulations was inconsistent.</p>
<p>Few industries exposed workers to significant danger, and reports of industrial accidents were rare. Workers can remove themselves from situations that endangered health or safety without jeopardy to their employment, and authorities effectively protected employees in this situation.</p>
