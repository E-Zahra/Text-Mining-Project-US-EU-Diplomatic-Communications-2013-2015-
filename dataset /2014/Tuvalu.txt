<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>Tuvalu is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. Parliamentary elections in 2010 were generally free and fair. In 2013, following a no-confidence vote that removed the incumbent, Willy Telavi, parliament selected opposition leader Enele Sopoaga as prime minister. Telavi resigned from his seat in parliament in August, and a by-election held on September 19 saw Satini Tulaga Manuella elected to replace him in parliament. Authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.</p>
<p>There were human rights problems in a few areas. In particular, traditional customs and social patterns perpetuated religious and social discrimination, including discrimination against women and minority religious groups. Domestic violence also was a problem.</p>
<p>Impunity was not a problem, as there were no reports that government officials committed human rights abuses.</p>

<h2>a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1bdisappearance">
<a class="goto" name="section1bdisappearance"></a>

<a class="goto" name="section1ctorture"></a>
<h2>c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that government officials employed them.</p>
<p>Local hereditary elders exercise traditional discretionary punishment and disciplinary authority. This includes the right to inflict corporal punishment for infringement of customary rules, but there were no reports of such corporal punishment during the year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1prisonand">
<a class="goto" name="section1prisonand"></a>
<h2>Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>Prison and detention center conditions generally met international standards.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: As of August the prison system held 11 convicted prisoners, all men. There were no juvenile offenders (defined as those under age 18) or pretrial detainees, and there were no deaths of inmates during the year. Prisoners had access to potable water and sufficient quantities of food. Sanitation and medical care were adequate.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Recordkeeping on prisoners was adequate. Although there were no official alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders, victims could request restitution in place of incarceration for offenders. The country does not have a formal ombudsman who can act on behalf of prisoners and detainees, but the “people’s lawyer” (public defender) was available to respond to prisoner complaints. Prisoners had access to visitors and permission for religious observance. Prisoners could submit complaints without censorship through the Office of the People’s Lawyer. The government did not investigate or monitor prison conditions and did not receive any complaints or allegations of inhuman conditions.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government permitted visits by independent human rights observers, but there were no visits during the year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1darbitrary">
<a class="goto" name="section1darbitrary"></a>
<h2>d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observed these prohibitions.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Role of the Police and Security Apparatus</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The national police, under the Office of the Prime Minister, maintain internal security. The country has no military force. Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the national police service, and the government has effective mechanisms to investigate and punish police abuse and corruption. There were no reports of impunity involving the security forces.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The law permits arrests without a warrant if a police officer witnesses the commission of an unlawful act or has “reasonable suspicion” that an offense is about to be committed. Police estimated the majority of arrests were of this type. Police may hold a person arrested without a warrant for no more than 24 hours without a hearing before a magistrate. When a court issues an arrest warrant, the warrant will state the maximum permissible detention time before the court must hold a hearing, which is normally one to two weeks. Authorities did not hold suspects incommunicado or under house arrest.</p>
<p>Authorities generally informed arrested persons promptly of the charges against them, although bureaucratic delays sometimes occurred because persons charged with serious offenses must wait for trial during the semiannual session of the High Court. There was a functioning system of bail. A “people’s lawyer” was available free of charge to arrested persons and for other legal advice. Persons living on the outer islands did not have ready access to legal services because the “people’s lawyer” was based on the main island of Funafuti and traveled infrequently to the outer islands. The country had no attorneys in private practice.</p>

<a class="goto" name="section1edenial"></a>
<h2>e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected judicial independence.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Trial Procedures</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for the right to a fair public trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. The law provides for a presumption of innocence. Judges conduct trials and render verdicts; there are no juries. Defendants have the right to be informed promptly and in detail of the charges, including free interpretation, if necessary; consult with an attorney in a timely manner; and have access to the “people’s lawyer” and adequate time and resources to prepare a defense. They also have the right to confront witnesses, present witnesses and evidence, access government-held evidence, and appeal convictions. Defendants may not be compelled to testify or confess guilt.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Political Prisoners and Detainees</h3>

<h2>a. Freedom of Speech and Press</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respected these rights. An effective judiciary and a functioning democratic political system combined to promote freedom of speech and of the press.</p>
<p><u>Press Freedoms</u>: Although there were no government restrictions, the government’s Media Department controlled the country’s sole radio station. There were no locally based private, independent media.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Internet Freedom</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the internet or censor online content, and there were no credible reports that the government monitored private online communications without appropriate legal authority. Internet access was available mainly on Funafuti, although connections were slow, costly, and unreliable. According to the International Telecommunication Union, approximately 37 percent of the population used the internet in 2013.</p>

<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for freedom of assembly but also gives island chiefs the authority to restrict directly religious activities of organizations deemed a threat to the values and culture of the island community or deemed divisive, unsettling, or offensive to the people. The government continued to protect the right to choose freely and practice religion but called for religious organizations to abide by the island chiefs’ restrictions on public worship and public religious group meetings. Religious minorities practiced openly in violation of the restrictions. There were no reports of arrests or fines.</p>

<h2>Elections and Political Participation</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: The 2010 general parliamentary elections were generally free and fair.</p>
<p><u>Political Parties and Political Participation</u>: There were no formal political parties. Instead, the 15-member parliament tended to divide between an ad hoc faction with at least the necessary eight votes to form a government and an informal opposition faction.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: Participation by women in government and politics was limited, largely due to traditional perceptions of women’s role in society. In a 2011 by-election in one of the island constituencies, voters elected a woman to parliament. Until the August 2013 change in government, she also served as minister for home affairs and rural development.</p>
<p>There were no members of minorities in parliament or the cabinet.</p>

<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>The law provides criminal penalties for some forms of official corruption, such as theft; however, laws against corruption are weak. In contrast with past years, there were no reports of government corruption. The public, however, criticized government ministers’ and officials’ frequent overseas travel.</p>
<p>The law provides for annual public ministerial reports, but publication was irregular and often nonexistent.</p>
<p>Since 2009, together with Nauru and Kiribati, the country participated in three rounds of a subregional audit support program, an initiative of the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions, with the goal of enabling audits of public accounts to meet uniformly high standards in a timely manner.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: The Auditor General’s Office, responsible for providing government oversight, was underfunded and consequently lacked adequate staff and resources to operate effectively. When needed, the police play a role in investigating charges of corruption as well.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: The law requires income and asset disclosure. In August the government appointed an ombudsman to implement the leadership code and financial disclosure provision. The first chief ombudsman assumed the five-year post in October.</p>
<p><u>Public Access to Information</u>: No law provides for public access to government information. The government was somewhat cooperative in responding to individual requests for such information and provided limited copies of its annual budget documents to the public on request.</p>

<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>No nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) focused entirely on human rights, although no known barriers existed to the establishment of human rights groups. Some human rights advocates, such as the Tuvalu National Council of Women, operated under the auspices of the Tuvalu Association of NGOs, which was composed primarily of faith-based organizations. The few other local organizations involved in human rights issues generally operated without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Nonetheless, opportunities to publicize such information locally remained limited by the lack of local print and electronic media. Government officials were somewhat cooperative and responsive to local organizations’ views.</p>
<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The “people’s lawyer” monitored sentencing, equality before the law, and human rights issues in general. The institution had government support and could respond to requests for advice from the government.</p>

<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>The law prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and place of origin, and the government generally enforced these prohibitions. In 2005 the High Court stated it was a deliberate decision in the constitution originally to omit gender as a prohibited basis of discrimination; thus, there is no constitutional protection against sex discrimination.</p>

<h2>Women</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: Rape is a crime punishable by a minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment, but spousal rape is not included in the legal definition of this offense. According to police the courts prosecuted two attempted rape cases, five indecent assault cases, and three sexual assault cases during the year.</p>
<p>The law recognizes domestic violence as a criminal offense. Prosecutions occur under the assault provisions of the penal code. The maximum penalty for common assault is six months’ imprisonment, and for assault with actual bodily harm, five years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p>The police have a Domestic Violence Unit and a “no-drop” (evidence-based) prosecution policy in cases of violence against women and operated a 24-hour emergency line for victims of domestic violence. The law recognizes the existence of domestic violence and gives express powers for police involvement and intervention, including the power to enter private property. Police may also issue orders for a person who has committed an act of domestic violence to vacate property, whether or not that individual has rights in that property, if a person at risk of further violence occupies it. The Department of Gender Affairs held an introductory training of trainers on gender issues in July with male leaders in government and in the community. The government participated in a regional program providing training for police and revised a memorandum of understanding with the Tuvalu National Council of Women for handling domestic violence cases. The Women’s Crisis Center, operated by the Tuvalu National Council of Women, provided counseling services, but there were no shelters for abused women. As of August the police reported 100 domestic violence cases. Cases of rape and domestic violence went unreported due to lack of awareness of women’s rights and traditional and cultural pressures on victims.</p>
<p><u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)</u>: The law prohibits FGM/C, and there were no reports of such practices.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: The law does not specifically prohibit sexual harassment but prohibits indecent behavior, which includes lewd touching. Sexual harassment was not widely reported, nor were there known cases reported during the year.</p>
<p><u>Reproductive Rights</u>: Couples and individuals have the right to decide freely the number, spacing, and timing of their children, and couples have the means and information to do so and to attain the highest standard of reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion, and violence. The NGO Tuvalu Family Health Association provided information and education about, and access to, contraception. Government hospitals offered family planning services and provided free prenatal, obstetric, and postnatal care. Trained health personnel attended many births.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: There remain areas in which the law contributes to an unequal status for women, such as land inheritance and child custody rights. There are no laws preventing employment discrimination based on gender or requiring equal pay for equal work. Women held a subordinate societal position, constrained in some instances both by law and traditional customary practices. Nonetheless, women increasingly held positions in the health and education sectors, headed a number of NGOs, and were more active politically. In the wage economy, men held most higher-paying positions, while women held the majority of lower-paying clerical and retail positions. Additionally, few women could access credit to start businesses.</p>
<p>There is a Department of Gender Affairs within the Prime Minister’s Office.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Citizenship derives through one’s parents. The law requires registration of births within 10 days, a practice generally observed.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: The government did not compile child abuse statistics, and there were no reported cases of child abuse during the year. Anecdotal evidence, however, indicated that child abuse occurred. The law confirms the right of parents, teachers, and others having lawful control of a child to use corporal punishment, and reports indicated this occurred in schools and homes.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: The legal minimum age of marriage for both girls and boys is 16 years. From 2002 to 2012, approximately 10 percent of children married by the age of 18.</p>
<p><u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)</u>: The law prohibits FGM/C, and there were no reports of such practices.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: The age of consent for sexual relations is 15. Sexual relations with a girl below age 13 are punishable by up to life imprisonment. Sexual relations with a girl older than 12 but younger than 15 are punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. The victim’s consent is irrelevant under both these provisions; however, in the latter case, reasonable belief the victim was 15 or older is a permissible defense. No provision of law pertains specifically to child pornography, although the penal code prohibits obscene publications in general.</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.</p>

<h2>Persons with Disabilities</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law does not specifically prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, including in employment, education, air travel and other transport, or the provision of other state services. Supplementary state services to address the special needs of persons with disabilities were very limited. There are no mandated building accessibility provisions for persons with disabilities. The one multi-story government building had nonoperational elevators, and there were no elevators in other multi-story buildings. Persons with disabilities had limited access to information and communications. The Fusi Alofa Association (Tuvalu National Disabled Persons Organization) and the Tuvalu Red Cross undertook regular home visits to persons with disabilities and conducted educational programs to raise community awareness of the rights of persons with disabilities and advocate for such persons.</p>
<p>Children with disabilities reportedly had lower school attendance rates at all levels than other children. Some students with disabilities attended government-run public primary schools both in Funafuti and in several outer islands. The Fusi Alofa Association operates a special school for children with disabilities in Funafuti. Parents make the decision concerning which school a child with disabilities attends after consultation with a Fusi Alofa Association advisor.</p>
<p>The Community Affairs Department in the Ministry of Home Affairs and Rural Development is responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.</p>

<h2>Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>Sexual conduct between men is illegal, with maximum penalties of seven to 15 years’ imprisonment depending on the nature of the offense, but there were no reports of prosecutions of consenting adults under these provisions. The law does not specifically prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. There are no hate crime laws, nor are there criminal justice mechanisms to aid in the prosecution of bias-motivated crimes against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. There were no reports of violence against persons based on sexual orientation or gender identity, but social stigma or intimidation may have prevented reporting of incidents of discrimination or violence.</p>

<h2>HIV and AIDS Social Stigma</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>Persons with HIV/AIDS faced some societal and employment discrimination. Local agents of foreign companies that hired seafarers from Tuvalu to work abroad barred persons with HIV/AIDS from employment. The government and NGOs cooperated to inform the public about HIV/AIDS and counter discrimination. There were no reports of violence against persons based on HIV/AIDS status.</p>

<h2>a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for the right of private-sector workers to form and join independent unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal strikes. The law does not permit public-sector employees such as civil servants, teachers, and nurses to form and join unions; however, they may join professional associations that have the right to bargain collectively but not the right to strike. No laws prohibit antiunion discrimination.</p>
<p>In general the government effectively enforced these laws. By law employers who violate laws on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining were liable to fines of up to A$100 ($93) depending on the violation, and in some cases imprisonment for up to six months. The law also provides for voluntary conciliation, arbitration, and settlement procedures in cases of labor disputes. In general these procedures were not subject to lengthy delays or appeals.</p>
<p>Although there are provisions for collective bargaining and the right to strike, the few individual private-sector employers set their own wage scales. Both the private and public sectors generally used nonconfrontational deliberations to resolve labor disputes. There was only one registered trade union, the Tuvalu Overseas Seamen’s Union. There were no reports of antiunion discrimination.</p>

<h2>b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor and states that any person who exacts, procures, or employs forced or compulsory labor is liable to a fine of A$100 ($93). The government effectively enforced the law. There were no reports of forced labor occurring in the country during the year.</p>

<h2>c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits children under 14 from working in the formal labor market. The law also prohibits children under 15 from industrial employment or work on any ship and stipulates that children under 18 are not allowed to enter into formal contracts, including work contracts. A separate provision of law, however, allows children 15 or older to enter into apprenticeships of up to five years, subject to approval by the commissioner of labor. There are restrictions on the type of work a child apprentice may perform, and he or she must receive a medical examination and be determined physically and mentally fit for employment in the specified occupation. Apprentices may lawfully live away from their families; in such cases, the contract must adequately provide for the supply of food, clothing, accommodation, and medical attention for the apprentice. Boys under 18 may work underground in mines with certain restrictions. There are no restrictions under law prohibiting girls ages 15 to 17 from working in underground mines, aboard ships, or during the night.</p>
<p>The government did not have sufficient resources to monitor and enforce child labor law provisions and depended instead on communities to report offenses. Children rarely engaged in formal employment but worked in subsistence farming and fishing.</p>

<h2>d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment or Occupation</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>Labor laws and regulations do not prohibit discrimination regarding race, gender, disability, language, sexual orientation, gender identity, HIV-positive status or other communicable diseases, or social status, and these persons sometimes experienced discriminatory practices. Discrimination in employment and wages occurred with respect to women (see section 6).</p>

<h2>e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for the government to set a minimum wage. As of November, however, the Department of Labor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Tourism, Environment, and Labor had not set a national minimum wage rate. The minimum annual salary in the public sector was approximately A$3,000 to A$4,000 ($2,800 to $3,720). No recent poverty-level income figure was available. According to the Department of Labor, the minimum salary barely sufficed to allow a worker and family in the wage economy to maintain a decent standard of living. Private-sector wages were reportedly somewhat lower than the minimum public-sector wage rate.</p>
<p>The law sets the workday at eight hours, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Tourism, Environment, and Labor may specify the days and hours of work for workers in various industries. Although there is provision in the law for premium pay for overtime work, there are no established premium overtime rates. The law provides for rudimentary health and safety standards and requires employers to provide adequate potable water, basic sanitary facilities, and medical care. Workers can remove themselves from situations that endangered health or safety without jeopardy to their employment, and authorities effectively protected employees in this situation.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Tourism, Environment, and Labor is responsible for the enforcement of wage, hour, health, and safety regulations, but the ministry did not have sufficient resources to formally and regularly conduct inspections of the laws’ application. By law penalties for violations of laws related to acceptable conditions of work could be liable to fines of up to A$100 ($93) depending on the violation, or imprisonment for up to six months if the person failed to pay an imposed fine. The Department of Labor had only one staff member, who relied on information from the community and conducted inspections when the office received complaints.</p>
<p>Most of the working-age population (approximately 75 percent) lacked permanent employment and worked in the informal and subsistence economy. There were no reported cases of workplace injuries or deaths.</p>
