<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>The Principality of Monaco is a constitutional monarchy in which the sovereign prince plays the leading governmental role. The prince appoints the government consisting of a minister of state and five ministers. The prince shares the country’s legislative power with the popularly elected National Council. Multi-party elections for the National Council in 2012 were considered free and fair. Authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.</p>
<p>The electoral system allows citizens to change many aspects of their government, but they cannot change the hereditary monarchy, which plays a substantial role in governing the country. The country’s detention center lacked hot meals and an exercise area, and authorities had in service three small “box” cells 10 square feet in size. Prisoners also lacked sunlight for most of the day.</p>
<p>The government punished officials who committed abuses.</p>

<div class="sub-section section1prisonand">
<a class="goto" name="section1prisonand"></a>
<h2>Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>Prison and detention center conditions generally met international standards. Authorities usually sent non-Monegasques sentenced to long prison terms to France to serve their terms.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: As of September there were 23 prisoners and detainees in the country. Of these, two were juveniles and four were women. The prison had a capacity of 81 persons, and the detention center had a capacity of six persons. The prisoners had access to potable water in the detention center and the prison. The food was adequate, and there were no shortages.</p>
<p>In December 2013 the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) published a report of the visit of a delegation to the country’s prison and mental hospital in 2012. The report noted the lack of outdoor exercise space in the jail for persons detained longer than 24 hours. It found the diet in the center, consisting of sandwiches and beverages, inadequate and recommended the menu include hot meals. The CPT noted authorities had in service three “box” cells of approximately 10 square feet in size. In the prison the CPT noted prisoners’ continuing lack of access to sunlight for most of the day. Prisoners also had limited ability to receive and possess personal property.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Recordkeeping on prisoners was adequate. Authorities used alternatives to sentencing for nonviolent offenders. Prison ombudsmen were available to respond to complaints. Prisoners and detainees had access to visitors. Prisoners could observe their religious practices and could submit complaints to judicial authorities without censorship. Authorities investigated credible allegations of inhuman conditions.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government permitted monitoring by independent nongovernmental observers as well as regularly scheduled visits by the CPT.</p>
<p><u>Improvements</u>: The country’s sole detention center developed sports activities for the detainees and created an end-of-year-gratuity for each detainee.</p>

<a class="goto" name="section1darbitrary"></a>
<h2>d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observed these prohibitions.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Role of the Police and Security Apparatus</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Justice have responsibility in law and practice for law enforcement and maintenance of order within the country. Both ministries report to their own ministers, who in turn report to the minister of state.</p>
<p>Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the national police and the Palace Guards. The government has effective mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption. There were no reports during the year of impunity involving the security forces.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>Arrest warrants are required. A detainee must appear before an investigating magistrate within 24 hours of arrest to be informed of the charges against him and of his rights under the law, and authorities generally respected this requirement. Authorities released most detainees without bail, but the investigating magistrate may order detention on grounds that the suspect might flee or interfere with the investigation of the case. Monaco and France worked cooperatively to return any fugitive who fled from Monaco into France. Detainees generally had prompt access to a lawyer, and the government provided one to indigent defendants. The investigating magistrate may extend indefinitely the initial two-month detention for additional two-month periods. The investigating magistrate customarily permitted family members to see detainees.</p>

<a class="goto" name="section1edenial"></a>
<h2>e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected judicial independence.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Trial Procedures</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and the judiciary generally enforced this right. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence, are generally informed promptly and in detail of the charges against them, and have access to free interpretation if necessary. Except for cases involving minors, trials are conducted in public, usually before a judge or tribunal of judges. There were no undue delays. A single judge decides most cases, but, in cases where the potential punishment exceeds 10 years’ imprisonment, a panel of professional and lay judges hears the case. Defendants have the right to be present and to consult with an attorney in a timely manner. An attorney is provided at public expense, if needed, when defendants face serious criminal charges. Defendants and their counsel have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense and access to government-held evidence relevant to their cases. Defendants are able to question the testimony of prosecution witnesses against them and present witnesses and evidence in their defense. They cannot be compelled to testify or confess guilt. Defendants have a right to appeal.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Political Prisoners and Detainees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Civil Judicial Procedures and Remedies</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The country has an independent and impartial judiciary in civil matters, and residents have access to a court to bring lawsuits seeking damages for, or cessation of, a human rights violation. Plaintiffs regularly used available administrative remedies to seek redress for alleged wrongs. The government respected court decisions pertaining to human rights.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Regional Human Rights Court Decisions</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The country is subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court for Human Rights (ECHR), and plaintiffs may appeal decisions involving alleged human rights violations to the ECHR after they exhaust remedies in domestic courts.</p>

<h2>a. Freedom of Speech and Press</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respected these rights. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combined to promote freedom of speech and press.</p>
<p><u>Freedom of Speech</u>: The law prohibits public “denunciations” of the ruling family and provides for punishment of six months’ to five years’ imprisonment for violations. Authorities did not charge anyone with violating these statutes during the year.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Internet Freedom</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the internet or censor online content, and there were no credible reports the government monitored private online communications without appropriate legal authority.

<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The law does not provide for the granting of asylum or refugee status, and the government has not established a system for providing protection to refugees.

<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The government’s mediation service is available to residents seeking redress against administrative decisions. In a report issued March 19, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance noted that in October 2013 a sovereign order created the Office of the High Commissioner for the Protection of the Rights and Freedoms and Mediation (Office of the High Commissioner). The high commissioner’s competencies include the protection of human rights and the fight against discrimination. The order also shifted responsibility for mediation to the new institution. The office acted independently, had adequate resources, and was considered effective.</p>

<h2>a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law and supporting regulations provide for the right of workers, including foreign workers, to form and join independent unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal strikes. Union representatives may be fired only with the agreement of a commission that includes two members from the employers’ association and two from the labor movement. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited. The government generally respected these rights, although government workers do not have the right to strike.</p>
<p>The government generally enforced the law. Resources, inspections, and remediation efforts were adequate. Violations were punishable by a fine or imprisonment for three months to a year. The government provides the assistance of mediators for private or professional conflicts to avoid long and costly court procedures and to find a solution acceptable to all parties to the dispute.</p>

<h2>d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment or Occupation</h2>

<h2>e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The legal minimum wage for fulltime work is the French minimum wage, 9.53 euros ($11.91) per hour, plus a 5-percent adjustment to compensate for the travel costs for the three-quarters of the workforce who commute to work daily from outside the country. Most workers received more than the minimum wage.</p>
<p>The legal workweek is 39 hours. The government allowed companies to reduce the workweek to 35 hours, but companies rarely did so. Regulations provide for a minimum number of rest periods and premium pay for overtime. There is a ceiling of nine hours of overtime per week or 46 hours of overtime over 12 consecutive weeks.</p>
<p>Law and government decree fix health and safety standards, which workplace health and safety committees and government labor inspectors enforced. There were no reports of labor law violations. The Department of Employment in the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs had several labor inspectors. The chief inspector answered directly to the director of the Department of Employment. Labor inspectors informed employers and employees on all matters related to labor laws, as well as health and safety standards. They arbitrated, mediated, and reconciled labor-management disputes. When possible, they carried out onsite inspections to ensure employers respected all requirements of the law. Workers can remove themselves from situations endangering health or safety without jeopardy to their employment, and authorities effectively protected this right.</p>
