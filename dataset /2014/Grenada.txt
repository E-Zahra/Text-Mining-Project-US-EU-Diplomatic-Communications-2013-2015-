<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>Grenada is a parliamentary democracy with a bicameral legislature. Observers considered the February 2013 elections to be generally free and fair, where the New National Party won all 15 seats in the House of Representatives and Keith Mitchell was sworn in as prime minister. Authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.</p>
<p>Human rights problems included poor prison conditions, violence against women, instances of child abuse, and laws that discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) persons.</p>
<p>The government took steps to punish security force members or other officials who committed abuses, and impunity was not perceived to be a problem.</p>

<h2>a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports the government or its agents committed any political killings. As of September police killed one person in the line of duty. Police shot and killed a suspect brandishing a knife in an armed robbery. The police Criminal Investigation Department, in coordination with the Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP), opened an investigation into this case.</p>
<p>After authorities initially charged five police officers with manslaughter for the 2011 death of Canadian-Grenadian citizen Oscar Bartholomew while in police custody, the DPP appealed the March decision by a judge to reinstate the five officers into the Royal Grenada Police Force (RGPF) and compensate them for back pay during their suspension. The judge also ruled a coroner’s inquest must be held before the criminal case could proceed. The inquest commenced on April 5 and was in progress as of October.</p>

<div class="sub-section section1bdisappearance">
<a class="goto" name="section1bdisappearance"></a>
<h2>b. Disappearance</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1ctorture">
<a class="goto" name="section1ctorture"></a>
<h2>c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law prohibit such practices. Flogging, a legal form of punishment for sex crimes and assault, was not uncommon.</p>
<p>While the media reported claims of police mistreatment, victims brought no charges, largely because those who made the claims chose not to file criminal complaints.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1prisonand">
<a class="goto" name="section1prisonand"></a>
<h2>Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>Prison and detention center conditions did not meet international standards, and overcrowding was a serious problem.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: In the sole penitentiary, as of September there were 484 prisoners, of whom five were women, held in space designed for 198 persons. Prisoners had access to adequate food, and potable water supplied by the water utility normally was available in prison hallways but not in the cells. During the dry season, when the water supply is cut off on occasion, a tank serves as a back-up.</p>
<p>The prison maintained an education program for the inmates, employed a counselor to work with the prison population, and beginning in July implemented the final phase of a program to work with young prisoners on their reinsertion into society.</p>
<p>Authorities held women in a separate section of the prison from men. There was no separate facility for the 32 juveniles held at the prison.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: Prison administrators keep adequate records. Authorities utilized alternatives to sentencing for young, nonviolent offenders, including a six-month program requiring daily participation. Upon completion of the program, 75 percent of participants returned to the educational system, while others received job training and placement. Prisoners and detainees had access to visitors three times per week. Authorities permitted prisoners to conduct religious observances. Prisoners may raise complaints directly with prison authorities, through their lawyers, or through the government’s prison visiting committee. While there was no specific prison ombudsman, prisoners relied on the prison welfare officer, a senior prison official, to process complaints and make contact with outside institutions.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The prison visiting committee monitors prison conditions. Visits from independent nongovernmental observers were welcome, but there were no such requests during the year.</p>
<p><u>Improvements</u>: The government continued a mandatory program focused on young and first-time offenders to improve life skills and anger management.</p>

<a class="goto" name="section1darbitrary"></a>
<h2>d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observed these prohibitions.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Role of the Police and Security Apparatus</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The RGPF, led by the police commissioner, maintains internal security. The country does not have a military. The RGPF encompasses the Coast Guard, special service unit, fire-fighting unit, and other specialized units. The RGPF is supplemented by 250 rural constables. The RGPF generally was effective at responding to complaints and maintained a community-policing program.</p>
<p>The police report to the minister for national security, who is also the prime minister. The police commissioner can discipline officers (up to the rank of sergeant) in cases of brutality, with penalties that include dismissal. Only the public service commission can discipline officers with the rank of inspector or higher. The police Criminal Investigation Department, in coordination with the DPP, is charged with investigating killings by police officers, should they occur. After a DPP review, and in cases not involving criminal liability, authorities refer them to the coroner for an inquest. Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the RGPF, and the government had effective mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption. In the case of deaths attributed to the RGPF, police conduct the investigations, which the DPP and the coroner review. There were no reports of impunity involving the security forces during the year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law permit police to detain persons on suspicion without a warrant, but they must bring formal charges within 48 hours, and authorities generally respected this limit. Authorities granted detainees access to a lawyer and family members within 24 hours. The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality of detention within 15 days after arrest on a criminal charge. The police must formally arraign or release a detained person within 60 days, and the authorities generally followed these procedures. There is a functioning system of bail, although persons charged with capital offenses are not eligible. Detainees charged with treason may be accorded bail only upon the recommendation of the governor general.</p>

<h2>e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected judicial independence.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Trial Procedures</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law provide for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right.</p>
<p>There is a presumption of innocence, and the law protects persons against self-incrimination and requires the police to explain a person’s rights upon arrest. The accused has the right to remain silent and to seek the advice of legal counsel. The law allows a defense lawyer to be present during interrogation and to advise the accused on how to respond to questions. Defendants and their counsel generally had adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense. Defendants have a right to a fair trial, without undue delay, although case backlogs meant periods of several months to a year before many cases went to trial. The accused has the right to confront his or her accuser, present evidence, call witnesses, access government-held evidence, and appeal. There are jury trials in the High Court only; trials are open to the public unless the charges are sexual in nature or a minor is involved.</p>
<p>The court appoints attorneys for indigents in cases of murder or other capital crimes. In other criminal cases that reach the appellate stage, the court appoints a lawyer to represent the accused if the defendant was not represented previously or reappoints earlier counsel if the appellant can no longer afford that lawyer’s services. With the exception of foreign-born drug suspects or persons charged with murder, the courts granted most defendants bail while awaiting trial.</p>

<h2>a. Freedom of Speech and Press</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respected these rights. The independent media were active and expressed a wide variety of views without restriction.</p>
<p><u>Libel Laws/National Security</u>: In late 2013 parliament enacted an Electronic Crimes Act that criminalized defamation via electronic media. Civil society and international observers criticized the measure, calling it a threat to freedom of speech and of the press. Parliament removed the controversial sections of the legislation via amendment in March.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Internet Freedom</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the internet or censor online content, and there were no credible reports the government monitored private online communications without appropriate legal authority.

<p><u>Recent Elections</u>: In the February 13 general elections the New National Party won all 15 seats in the House of Representatives, defeating the National Democratic Congress, which had governed for more than four years. The Organization of American States led an election observer mission, which deemed the elections generally free and fair.</p>
<p><u>Participation of Women and Minorities</u>: Five women served in the House of Representatives. Two of the 13 appointed senators were women. Four female legislators served as ministers of government, and the government appointed its country’s first female governor general in May 2013.

<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>The law provides criminal penalties for official corruption. While there was a perception, particularly among the political opposition and some media outlets, that the government did not implement the law effectively, there were no new cases or serious allegations of public corruption during the year.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: Allegations continued to circulate of instances in prior years of corrupt practices by government officials, but subsequent investigations did not report any findings of corruption. The Integrity in Public Life Commission is responsible for combating corruption, while the ombudsman’s office, in its capacity as an independent organ with the powers to investigate maladministration, has a role as well. The ombudsman’s office continued to operate independently and to cooperate with the media and other elements of civil society.</p>
<p>Parliament repealed the existing Integrity in Public Life Act in March 2013 and later that year passed the Integrity in Public Life Bill, 2013, which entered into force in October 2013.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: The anticorruption legislation contained in the Integrity in Public Life Bill, 2013, requires all public servants to report their income and assets, beginning with members of the Integrity in Public Life Commission. The commission monitors and verifies disclosures, although disclosures are not made public except for the possibility of eventual disclosure in court. According to the provisions of the bill, failure to file a disclosure should be noted in the <i>Official Gazette</i>. If the office holder in question fails to file in response to this notification, the commission can seek a court order to enforce compliance, and a judge can impose conditions to such order as he or she deems appropriate.</p>
<p><u>Public Access to Information</u>: Although no law provides for public access to government information, citizens may request access to any information not deemed classified. Statistics on government responsiveness to those requests were not available.</p>

<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>The constitution and law prohibit discrimination based on race, place of origin, political opinion, color, creed, or gender, and the government generally upheld these prohibitions.</p>
</div><div class="sub-section section6women">
<a class="goto" name="section6women"></a>
<h2>Women</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: The law criminalizes rape, including spousal rape, and stipulates a sentence of flogging or up to 30 years’ imprisonment for a conviction of any nonconsensual form of sex. Authorities referred 43 charges involving rape or related crimes for prosecution, and the court convicted 26 defendants as of September.</p>
<p>According to women’s rights monitors, violence against women remained a serious and pervasive problem. The law prohibits domestic violence and provides for penalties at the discretion of the presiding judge based on the severity of the offense. The central statistical office reported 240 cases of domestic violence, 206 against women and 34 against men, as of September. Police and judicial authorities usually acted promptly in cases of domestic violence. Sentences for assault against a spouse vary according to the severity of the incident. A shelter accommodating a maximum of 16 battered and abused women and their children operated in the northern part of the country, and it housed seven residents as of late August; it was staffed by medical and psychological counseling personnel. Victims and persons seeking to report cases of abuse could contact the Ministry of Social Development and local ministry offices in three parishes and the island of Carriacou. Domestic violence remained underreported, as many women feared retribution, stigma, or further violence, and many were economically dependent on the perpetrators.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: The law prohibits sexual harassment, but there were no criminal penalties for it; the government noted it was a persistent problem. It is the responsibility of the complainant to bring a civil suit against an alleged harasser.</p>
<p><u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)</u>: No law prohibits FGM/C, and the practice was virtually nonexistent in the country.</p>
<p><u>Reproductive Rights</u>: The government recognized the basic right of couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing, and timing of their children; to obtain the information and means to do so; and to attain the highest standard of reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion, and violence. Couples and individuals also had access to modern contraception as well as obstetric and postnatal care. According to the UN Population Fund’s most recent estimates, skilled health personnel attended 99 percent of births, and 52 percent of women ages 15-49 used a modern method of contraception. Women had access to emergency health care, including services for the management of complications from abortion.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: Women generally enjoyed the same rights as men, and there was no evidence of formal discrimination in education. The Employment Act of 1999 mandates equal pay for equal work. Justice system officials reported there were no allegations of violations of the equal pay for equal work provision during the year. Television and radio public service announcements continued to combat spousal abuse and raise women’s awareness of their rights.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: Citizenship is derived from birth in the country or, if abroad, by birth to a Grenadian parent upon petition. There is universal birth registration.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: Through July government social service agencies reported 205 cases of child abuse, including 92 cases of physical abuse and 113 cases of sexual abuse. Three cases of incest went to court. Authorities placed abused children either in a government-run home or in private foster homes. The law stipulates penalties ranging from five to 15 years’ imprisonment for those convicted of child abuse and disallows the victim’s alleged “consent” as a defense in cases of incest. The Social Welfare Division within the Ministry of Social Development provided probationary and rehabilitative services to youth, day-care services, and social work programs to families; assistance to families wishing to adopt or provide foster care to children; and financial assistance to the six children’s homes run by private organizations.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: The legal minimum age for marriage is 21, although persons as young as 18 can be married with parental consent in writing. There was no data on marriages of persons under the age of 18.</p>
<p><u>Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)</u>: No law prohibits FGM/C, and the practice was virtually nonexistent in the country.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: A statutory rape law applies when the victim is 16 years and under. Penalties are 30 years’ imprisonment if the victim is less than 14, and 15 years’ imprisonment if the victim is 14 to 16 years of age. The law prohibits the posting and circulation of child pornography. The law also prohibits the importation, sale, and public display of pornography. The criminal code prohibits sale and trafficking of children for prostitution, for the production of pornography, or for pornographic performances.</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.</p>

<h2>Anti-Semitism</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination, including anti-Semitic acts. A Chabad Center opened in December 2013 primarily to serve the approximately 500 Jewish students and staff at St. George’s University.</p>

<h2>Persons with Disabilities</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, but the constitution and law do not protect persons with disabilities from discrimination in the provision of state services. Although the law does not mandate access to public buildings or services, building owners increasingly incorporated accessibility features into new construction and premises renovation. The government provided for special education throughout the school system; however, for practical reasons, most parents chose to send their children to three special education schools operating in the country. The government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) continued to provide training and work opportunities for such persons. The Ministry of Social Development includes an office responsible for looking after persons with disabilities, as well as a council for the disabled, which reviews disability-related issues.</p>

<h2>Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activities between men and provides penalties of up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The law makes no provision for same-sex sexual activities between women. No laws prohibit discrimination against a person on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing, education, or health care.</p>
<p>Society generally was intolerant of same-sex sexual conduct, and many churches condemned it. Most LGBT persons were not open about their sexual orientation or gender identity. The Grenada Caribbean HIV/AIDS program (GrenCHAP) participated on the national AIDS council, served as an advocate for LGBT persons and at-risk populations, and experienced no impediments to its operations.</p>
<p>There were no gay pride events. There were no reports of violence linked to real or perceived sexual orientation. Persons who were subjected to rumors regarding their sexual orientation complained their livelihoods were affected.</p>

<h2>HIV and AIDS Social Stigma</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>It was not uncommon for persons to be shunned by family members or face discrimination in housing and employment when their HIV-positive status became known. According to civil society contacts, fear of disclosing status prevented some persons with HIV/AIDS from seeking services provided by government or civil society. While the government acted to ameliorate concerns by the public about persons with HIV, it moved less quickly to finalize policies in draft or to act on recommendations provided by the HIV-positive community. The government encouraged citizens to be tested and get treatment. NGOs such as GrenCHAP and Hope Pals provided counseling to those affected by HIV/AIDS, made recommendations to the government on outreach and policy, and urged local companies to educate themselves and their workers about HIV/AIDS in the workplace and not to discriminate against employees with the disease.</p>

<h2>a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for the rights of workers to form and join independent labor unions, participate in collective bargaining, and, with some restrictions, conduct legal strikes. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination. It requires employers to recognize a union that represents the majority of workers in a particular business but does not oblige employers to recognize a union formed by their employees if the majority of the workforce does not belong to the union. Labor law covers all categories of employees, including domestic workers and migrants.</p>
<p>While workers in essential services have the right to strike, the labor minister may refer disputes involving essential services to compulsory arbitration. The government’s list of essential services is broad and includes services not regarded by the International Labor Organization as essential. While authorities can order employers to rehire employees if a court finds they were discharged illegally, there were no such cases during the year.</p>
<p>The government generally enforced labor laws. Penalties for abuses of labor laws can range from $5,000 Eastern Caribbean Dollars (XCD) ($1,852) or six months’ imprisonment to $10,000 XCD ($3,704) or three years’ imprisonment. Administrative and judicial procedures were subject to lengthy delays and appeals. Labor organizations continued to seek a change in labor laws to ensure timely resolution of disputes following labor action.</p>
<p>Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining were generally respected. Employers generally recognized and bargained with unions even if a majority of the workforce did not belong to a union.</p>

<div class="sub-section section7bprohibition">
<a class="goto" name="section7bprohibition"></a>
<h2>b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor. In May the government enacted the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Bill 2014, which prohibits all forms of forced labor, including specifically prohibiting the sale or trafficking of children for exploitive labor. The law establishes penalties of 25 years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of $500,000 XCD ($185,000) for forced labor, or $1 million XCD ($370,000) for child trafficking, including forced child labor.</p>
<p>The government effectively enforced the law; however, there was no specific information available on the amount of resources or number of inspections. There were no reports that forced labor occurred during the year.</p>

<div class="sub-section section7cprohibition">
<a class="goto" name="section7cprohibition"></a>
<h2>c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The statutory minimum age for employment of children is 16 years. The law permits employment for minors under 18 as long as certain conditions related to hours, insurance, and working conditions set forth in the labor code are met. There is no explicit prohibition against children’s involvement in hazardous work.</p>
<p>Inspectors from the Labor Ministry enforced the minimum age provision in the formal sector through periodic checks. Enforcement in the informal sector was insufficient, particularly for family farms. The Labor Ministry inspected family farms for child workers upon receipt of child labor allegations. There was no information on the adequacy of resources, number of inspections, remediation, penalties, or whether such penalties were sufficient to deter violations. There was no specific information provided on actions during the year to prevent child labor or remove children from such labor.</p>
<p>There were no reports of exploitive child labor during the year.</p>

<h2>d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment or Occupation</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits discrimination in respect to employment or occupation regarding race, color, national extraction, social origin, religion, political opinion, sex, age, or disability. The law does not prohibit discrimination in respect to employment or occupation regarding language, HIV-positive status or other communicable diseases, sexual orientation and/or gender identity. In general the government effectively enforced these laws and regulations. There were no reports discrimination with respect to employment and occupation occurred.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section7eacceptable">
<a class="goto" name="section7eacceptable"></a>
<h2>e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The minimum wage schedules set pay by occupation. The minimum wage for domestic workers, for example, was $4.50 XCD ($1.67) per hour, while that for a security guard was $9.00 XCD per hour ($3.33). The poverty income rate was estimated at $6,200 XCD per year ($2,296).</p>
<p>The law provides for a 40-hour maximum workweek. The law stipulates that employers must permit persons who work five hours consecutively a one-hour meal break. In addition the law states that employers may not ask domestic employees to work longer than a 10-hour period without at least two hours of breaks for meals and rest periods. The law requires premium pay for work above the standard workweek and prohibits excessive or compulsory overtime. The law mandates paid annual vacation of two weeks in the first year and three weeks thereafter. The government sets health and safety standards. There are legal provisions under which workers can remove themselves from situations endangering health or safety without jeopardizing their employment.</p>
<p>Enforcement, including wages, hours, occupational safety, and other elements, is the responsibility of the Ministry of Labor’s seven labor inspectors who are responsible for the full range of labor rights inspections, including workplace safety and the right to organize. Inspectors examined approximately 75 percent of eligible sites. The government effectively enforced minimum wage requirements and reported that no violations of the law concerning working hours were brought to the notice of government authorities. The government’s enforcement of occupational health and safety standards was inconsistent.</p>
<p>The government informally encouraged business to rectify violations without resorting to formal channels for compliance, including fines and penalties, which have never been used. There was no information provided on what the law sets as the amount for fines, or other penalties. Labor officers worked with employers in sectors such as energy, agriculture, and construction to promote appropriate clothing, health checks, and pesticide safety.</p>
<p>During the year the national insurance scheme received 306 claims of workplace injury. There were no workplace deaths reported.</p>
