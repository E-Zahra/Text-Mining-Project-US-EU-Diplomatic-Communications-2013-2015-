<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>Iceland is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The president is the head of state, and a prime minister, usually the leader of the largest party, is head of government. There is a unicameral parliament (Althingi). In 2012 voters re-elected Olafur Ragnar Grimsson president in a free and fair election. After free and fair parliamentary elections in April 2013, the Independence Party and the Progressive Party (PP) formed a governing coalition led by Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson (PP). Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.</p>
<p>The most significant human rights problems during the year included violence against women and children. Pretrial detainees sometimes shared cells with convicted prisoners, and juveniles sometimes shared cells with adults. There was some societal discrimination against immigrants, and workers without Icelandic language skills faced an increased risk of occupational accidents.</p>
<p>Other human rights problems included discrepancies in access to the healthcare system for asylum seekers who did not enter the country under international auspices, sexual harassment, trafficking in persons, and occasional discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment and access to public places.</p>
<p>There were no reports of officials committing violations in the security forces or elsewhere in the government.</p>

<h2>a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1bdisappearance">
<a class="goto" name="section1bdisappearance"></a>
<h2>b. Disappearance</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.</p>

<a class="goto" name="section1ctorture"></a>
<h2>c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law prohibit such practices, and there were no reports that government officials employed them.</p>

<div class="sub-section section1prisonand">
<a class="goto" name="section1prisonand"></a>
<h2>Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>Prison and detention center conditions generally met international standards.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: Authorities incarcerated female inmates in the Akureyri prison. Men were also held in this facility. Authorities closely monitored men held in facilities with women, and, with their mutual consent, men interacted with women only in the common areas and did not share cellblocks. The law states the government must accommodate juvenile offenders in establishments managed by the Government Agency for Child Protection unless there are special grounds for accommodating them in prison. In the period January 1-December 15, authorities held one child in detention with adults. Authorities held pretrial detainees with convicted prisoners.</p>
<p>Although overcrowding was generally not a problem, when it occurred at the main prison at Litla-Hraun or in Reykjavik’s main pretrial detention facility, authorities held pretrial detainees in jails in local police stations. As of December 15, there was a waiting list of approximately 480 persons convicted of crimes but unable to serve their sentences in prisons due to a lack of prison space. During the year there were no deaths in the country’s prisons and jails.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: The parliament’s ombudsman can take up a prison problem on his own initiative. Authorities permitted prisoners and detainees to submit complaints to judicial authorities and the parliament’s ombudsman without censorship and to request investigation of credible allegations of inhuman conditions if they so chose. There were no allegations of inhuman conditions during the year.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government permitted monitoring of prison conditions by independent local and international human rights groups, the media, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and international bodies, but no such visits occurred during the year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1darbitrary">
<a class="goto" name="section1darbitrary"></a>
<h2>d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observed these prohibitions.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Role of the Police and Security Apparatus</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The national police maintain internal security. In addition, the Icelandic Coast Guard (ICG) carries out general law-enforcement duties at sea. The national police, the nine regional police forces, and the ICG all fall under the purview of the Ministry of the Interior.</p>
<p>Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the police and the ICG, and the government has effective mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption. While there were no reports of impunity involving the security forces during the year, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance noted in a 2012 report there was no mechanism independent of the police and prosecution authorities for the investigation of allegations of police misconduct.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>Police may make arrests in a number of circumstances, such as when they believe a prosecutable offense has been committed, when they see a need to prevent further offenses or destruction of evidence, when they need to protect a suspect, or when a person refuses to obey police orders to move. The law explicitly requires warrants only for arresting individuals who fail to appear at court for a hearing or a trial, or at a prison to serve a sentence.</p>
<p>Authorities must promptly inform a person under arrest of his rights and bring him before a judge within 24 hours of arrest. There is no functioning bail system. The judge determines whether a suspect must remain in custody during the investigation. The judge may grant conditional release, subject to assurances that the accused will appear for trial. Upon arrival at the police station, the law entitles detainees to legal counsel, which the government provides for the indigent. There were no reports that suspects were detained incommunicado or held under house arrest.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1edenial">
<a class="goto" name="section1edenial"></a>
<h2>e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected judicial independence.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Trial Procedures</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law provide for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. Defendants are presumed innocent. Authorities must inform them of the charges against them promptly and in detail. Noncitizens have a right to interpretation. Trials are fair and take place without delay. They are generally public, but judges may close them at the defendant’s request or when minors are involved. Courts do not use juries, but multijudge panels are common. Defendants have access to legal counsel of their own choosing. The government covers attorneys’ fees of defendants unable to pay, but the law requires defendants found guilty to reimburse the government. Defendants have the right to adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense, to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, to present witnesses and evidence on their behalf, and to participate in the proceedings. They and their attorneys have access to government-held evidence relevant to their cases. At the discretion of the courts, prosecutors may introduce evidence that police obtained illegally. Defendants have the right not to be compelled to testify or confess guilt. Defendants have the right to appeal, and the Supreme Court handles appeals expeditiously. These rights extend to all defendants without prejudice.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Political Prisoners and Detainees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Civil Judicial Procedures and Remedies</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>Individuals may seek damages for, or cessation of, a human rights violation through domestic courts. They can appeal decisions involving alleged violations by the government of the European Convention on Human Rights to the European Court of Human Rights. Administrative remedies are also available for alleged wrongs.</p>
</div>

<a class="goto" name="section1farbitrary"></a>
<h2>f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and law prohibit interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and there were no reports the government failed to respect these prohibitions.</p>
<p>Immigration law allows authorities to conduct house searches without a prior court order when there is a significant risk that delay would jeopardize an investigation of immigration fraud. Immigration law also allows authorities to request DNA tests without court supervision in cases of suspected immigration fraud. As of October 21, authorities requested no DNA tests during the year.</p>

<h2>a. Freedom of Speech and Press</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution and the law provide for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respected these rights. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combined to promote freedom of speech and press.</p>
<p><u>Freedom of Speech and Expression</u>: The law establishes fines and imprisonment for up to two years for “[a]nyone who publicly mocks, defames, denigrates or threatens a person or group of persons by comments or expressions of another nature, for example by means of pictures or symbols for their nationality, color, race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity, or disseminates such materials.” There were no reports the government invoked this law during the year.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Internet Freedom</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the internet or censor online content, and there were no credible reports that the government monitored private online communications without appropriate legal authority. According to Statistics Iceland, 97 percent of households had internet access, and 99 percent of citizens used the internet in 2014.</p>

<a class="goto" name="section2dfreedom"></a>
<h2>d. Freedom of Movement, Internally Displaced Persons, Protection of Refugees, and Stateless Persons</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government generally respected these rights. The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in providing protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, refugees, returning refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons, or other persons of concern.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Protection of Refugees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The law provides for the granting of asylum or refugee status, and the government has established a system for providing protection to refugees. It allows for accelerated refusal of applications deemed to be “manifestly unfounded.” The minister of the interior instituted new procedures in August 2014 to reduce average processing times to no more than 90 days. While authorities were still processing asylum requests that originated before August 2014, the average processing times of asylum requests submitted during the year through September 30 was 87.4 days. An independent regulatory committee, the Immigration and Asylum Appeals Board, adjudicated asylum cases rejected by the Directorate of Immigration.</p>
<p>As of November 27, a total of 309 individuals applied for asylum, and as of November 24 the country granted asylum to 76 individuals.</p>
<p><u>Safe Country of Origin/Transit</u>: The country adheres to the EU’s Dublin III regulation, which allows for the return of asylum seekers to the country of entry into the EU. The country does not return asylum seekers to EU member states Greece and Hungary unless they already received protection in these countries.</p>
<p><u>Employment</u>: Some asylum seekers who had found a job, signed a job contract, and applied for a job permit had to wait up to four months to receive the permit, resulting in missed job opportunities.</p>
<p><u>Access to Basic Services</u>: Refugees accepted in the country based on a UNHCR assessment of overall resettlement needs (quota refugees) enjoyed access to the country’s health care system immediately upon arrival. In addition, all asylum seekers had access to the health care system as part of a package of benefits when living in housing provided by the Directorate of Immigration.</p>
<p>In order to be fully enrolled in the public health care system, there is a six-month waiting period (from the day they register their legal domicile in the country) for asylum seekers with the means and desire to provide their own housing or who have entered the job market during that time. These individuals are responsible for purchasing health insurance during the six-month waiting period. Critics argued that access to the health care system should be extended on arrival to any asylum seeker who opts to live outside of the Directorate of Immigration’s facilities or who starts work during that six-month period.</p>
<p>Some asylum seekers who had not been issued a national identification number experienced delays in receiving necessary health services.</p>
<p>Some children of asylum seekers waited up to two months to be able to attend school.</p>
<p><u>Durable Solutions</u>: In January the country received 13 Syrian refugees for permanent resettlement through UNHCR.</p>
<p><u>Temporary Protection</u>: The government also provided temporary protection to individuals who may not qualify as refugees and provided subsidiary protection to 15 persons and humanitarian protection to 70 others.</p>

<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: Most public officials were not subject to financial disclosure laws. The law requires members of parliament and government ministers who are not members of parliament to report their financial interests publicly on parliament’s website and to update this information within one month of receiving new information. As of the beginning of November, not every member had done so. There are no criminal or administrative sanctions for noncompliance.</p>

<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>A number of domestic and international human rights groups generally operated without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials were cooperative and responsive to their views.</p>
<p><u>Government Human Rights Bodies</u>: The parliament’s ombudsman, elected by parliament for a period of four years, secures the rights of the citizens to equal and impartial treatment in their dealings with public authorities. The ombudsman is independent from any orders, including from parliament, when exercising his functions. Individuals can lodge complaints with the ombudsman about the decisions, procedures, and conduct of public officials and government agencies. The ombudsman may demand official reports, documents, and records; may summon officials to give testimony; and has access to official premises. Government agencies generally responded to the ombudsman’s requests for information and documents within a reasonable time. While the ombudsman’s recommendations are not binding on authorities, the government generally adopted them. The ombudsman complained in 2014 that he did not have adequate resources to initiate investigations, and in some cases was not able to meet mandatory deadlines to collect information on government responses to the ombudsman’s recommendations and to collect and process information from cases.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Judicial Affairs and Education is responsible for legislative oversight of human rights in the country. The committee had adequate resources and was generally effective.</p>

<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>The constitution and law prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, religion, political opinion, national origin or citizenship, social origin, disability, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, age, language, HIV-positive status, or other communicable diseases. Various laws implement these prohibitions, and the government effectively enforced them.</p>
</div><div class="sub-section section6women">

<h2>Women</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p><u>Rape and Domestic Violence</u>: Rape carries a maximum penalty of 16 years in prison. Judges typically imposed sentences of two to three years. The law does not explicitly address spousal rape. Activists continued to complain that the burden of proof in rape cases was too heavy and discouraged victims from reporting acts of rape and authorities from prosecuting them. The government did not respond formally to these concerns.</p>
<p>While the law prohibits violence, it does not specifically address domestic violence. The penalties can range from a fine to 16 years in prison, depending on the type of violence committed. In addition, the law permits judges to increase the sentences of persons who commit violence against persons with whom they had a domestic relationship or other close bond. While judges utilized this provision to hand down stronger domestic violence sentences, one respected activist expressed concern that sentences were still too mild and too few.</p>
<p>Violence against women continued to be a problem. A large majority of victims historically declined to press charges or chose to forgo trial, in part to avoid publicity. In 2014, the most recent year for which data were available, 13.2 percent of the clients of the Counseling and Information Center for Survivors of Sexual Violence pressed charges. Some local human rights monitors attributed the underreporting of domestic violence and sex crimes to the infrequency of convictions and to traditionally light sentences. In the few cases of domestic violence that went to trial, the courts often continued to base sentences on precedent and rarely made full use of the more stringent sentencing authority available under the law.</p>
<p>Victims of domestic violence can request police to remove perpetrators physically from the home for up to four weeks at a time. Police can also impose a 72-hour restraining order to prevent abusers from coming into proximity with the victim, and courts can extend this restraining order for up to a year. The law entitles victims of sex crimes to a lawyer to advise them of their rights and to help them pursue charges against the alleged assailants. In 2014 a total of 120 women sought assistance at the rape crisis center of the National University Hospital of Iceland, and 100 women sought temporary lodging at the country’s shelter for women, mainly because of domestic violence. The shelter also offered counseling.</p>
<p>The government helped finance the Women’s Shelter, the Counseling and Information Center for Survivors of Sexual Violence, the rape crisis center of the national hospital, and other organizations that assisted victims of domestic or gender-based violence. In addition to partially funding such services, the government provided help to immigrant women in abusive relationships, offering emergency accommodation, counseling, and information on legal rights.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Harassment</u>: Two laws prohibit sexual harassment. The general penal code makes sexual harassment punishable by imprisonment for up to two years. The law on equal status defines sexual harassment more broadly as any type of unfair or offensive physical, verbal, or symbolic sexual behavior that is unwanted and affects the self-respect of the victim, and is continued despite a clear indication that the behavior is undesired. The law requires employers and organization supervisors to make specific arrangements to prevent employees, students, and clients from becoming victims of gender-based or sexual harassment. Victims of harassment can report incidents to the Complaints Committee on Equal Status. The law requires only employers with 25 or more employees to provide employees information on the legal prohibitions against sexual harassment in the workplace. The law establishes fines for violations, but more severe penalties could be applicable under other laws. According to the latest available information from the State Prosecutor’s Office, in 2014 prosecutors brought four cases to trial and obtained convictions in one at the district court level. One case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the conviction.</p>
<p><u>Reproductive Rights</u>: Couples and individuals have the right to decide the number, spacing, and timing of their children; manage their reproductive health; and have access to the information and means to do so, free from discrimination, coercion, or violence.</p>
<p><u>Discrimination</u>: The constitution states that “men and women shall enjoy equal rights in all respects.” The law does not prohibit discrimination, but it does not mandate different statuses for men and women in family, labor, property, nationality, and inheritance laws either. The law states that employers and unions should work towards gender equality in the labor market, especially in managerial positions, and that employers should work towards declassifying jobs as primarily female- or male-oriented. Employment discrimination occurred (see section 7.d.).</p>
<p>Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a pay gap existed between men and women. Using Eurostat’s methodology, Statistics Iceland published a report in May showing the gender pay gap amounted to 18.3 percent overall in 2014, with 19.9 percent in the private sector and 13.2 percent in the public sector. The survey did not take into consideration factors such as type of profession, education, age, and length of employment. According to a salary survey of its members conducted by the country’s largest labor union, the VR, and published in September, the gender-based pay gap amounted to 9.9 percent after taking into consideration age, length of employment, profession, job sector, education, number of employees supervised, number of hours worked, and shift work.</p>
<p>As of November 23, the Gender Equality Complaints Committee ruled that the law on equal status was violated six times. In the first case, the committee ruled that a district commissioner violated the law when the commissioner temporarily hired two men as police lieutenants instead of a woman, based on unsuitable and subjective standards for determining their qualifications. In the second case, the Ministry of the Interior violated the law by appointing three men as assistant chiefs of police at the Metropolitan Police District instead of a female candidate, based on sex-based discrimination in scoring her job interview. In the third case, the committee ruled that an unnamed entity violated the law when it hired a male applicant as its managing director instead of a more qualified woman. In the fourth case, an unnamed health center violated the law by hiring a woman instead of an equally qualified man as a psychologist where the ratio of female to male psychologists was greater. In the fifth case, the Central Bank of Iceland violated the law by establishing a lower starting salary for a female employee than for a male employee who started in an equal position at the same time. In the sixth case, the committee ruled that the Bishop of Iceland had violated the law by appointing a man instead of a woman to the position of a Lutheran minister after a selection committee failed to evaluate the two candidates on an equal basis.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p><u>Birth Registration</u>: A child acquires the country’s citizenship at birth if both parents are citizens, if the mother is a citizen, or if the father is a citizen and is married to the child’s foreign mother. If a mixed-nationality couple had obtained a judicial separation at the time when the child was conceived, however, the child acquires the mother’s citizenship. A stateless child can become a citizen at the age of three. In all cases a child’s access to social services depends on whether he or she has a residence permit in the country. Registration of birth was prompt.</p>
<p><u>Child Abuse</u>: In 2014, the latest year for which data were available, local child protection committees, whose work the Agency for Child Protection coordinates, received 1,986 reports of abuse, including 1,082 reports of emotional abuse, 472 of physical abuse, and 454 of sexual abuse (some cases counted as more than one kind of abuse).</p>
<p>The agency operated a diagnostic and short-term treatment center for abused and troubled minors, and was responsible for three long-term treatment facilities. It also coordinated the work of 27 committees throughout the country responsible for local management of child-protection problems. The local committees hired professionals with expertise in social work and child protection.</p>
<p>The government maintained a children’s assessment center to accelerate prosecution of child sexual abuse cases and lessen the trauma experienced by the child.</p>
<p>The prime minister appoints the children’s ombudsman, who acts independently of the government. The ombudsman’s mandate is to protect children’s rights, interests, and welfare. When investigating complaints, which typically involved physical and psychological abuse and inadequate accommodation for children with illnesses or disabilities, the ombudsman has access to all public and private institutions that housed or otherwise cared for children. The ombudsman is not empowered to intervene in individual cases but can investigate them for indications of a general trend. The ombudsman can also initiate cases at her discretion. While the ombudsman’s recommendations are not binding on authorities, generally the government adopted them.</p>
<p><u>Early and Forced Marriage</u>: The country’s minimum age for marriage is 18 for both sexes.</p>
<p><u>Sexual Exploitation of Children</u>: The law prohibits, with fines or imprisonment for up to two years, the payment, or promise to pay or render consideration of another type, for prostitution involving a child under the age of 18. The law prohibits child pornography, which is punishable by up to two years in prison. The law criminalizes statutory rape with incarceration for one to 16 years. The government effectively enforced these laws. The minimum age for consensual sex is 15.</p>
<p><u>International Child Abductions</u>: The country is a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. For information see the Department of State’s report on compliance at <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/childabduction/en/legal/compliance.html">travel.state.gov/content/childabduction/en/legal/compliance.html</a> and country-specific information at <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/childabduction/en/country/Iceland.html">travel.state.gov/content/childabduction/en/country/Iceland.html.</a></p>

<h2>Persons with Disabilities</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The constitution prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, education, air travel and other transportation, access to health care, and the provision of other government services. The law provides that persons with disabilities receive preference for government and municipal jobs when they are at least as qualified as other applicants. Disability rights advocates asserted that the government did not fully implement the constitution and the law and that persons with disabilities constituted a majority of the country’s poor.</p>
<p>The law provides that persons with disabilities have access to buildings, information, and communications. Building regulations prescribe that buildings and building premises be designed in accordance with “universal design.” Universal design is meant to ensure that persons are not discriminated against on the basis of a disability or illness regarding access or the general use of buildings, and to ensure that people can safely enter and exit buildings, even under abnormal circumstances, such as in the case of fire. Disability rights advocates complained that authorities did not fully implemented the law and regulations and access to public information was unsatisfactory, since not all persons with disabilities, in particular persons with vision disabilities, had access to the internet. While violations of these regulations are punishable by a fine or a jail sentence of up to two years, one of the main associations for persons with disabilities contended that authorities rarely, if ever, assessed penalties for noncompliance.</p>
<p>Employment discrimination occurred (see section 7.d.).</p>
<p>The Ministry of Welfare was the lead government body responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. The municipalities in each of the country’s 10 regions are responsible for organizing and delivering services and support to persons with disabilities. The Ministry of Welfare maintained a diagnostic and advisory center in Reykjavik that aimed to create conditions allowing persons with disabilities to lead normal lives.</p>

<h2>Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>While the constitution does not specifically prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, it does so implicitly. The law prohibits anyone from denying a person goods or services on an equal footing with others on grounds of that person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. It also prohibits denying a person access on the same footing as others to a public meeting place or other places open to the public. The law further prohibits incitement to hatred against persons on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and the dissemination of hateful material.</p>

<h2>a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for the right of workers to form and join independent unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal strikes, and the government respected these rights. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination. It is silent on whether workers fired for union activity should be reinstated, but it provides for fining employers who engage in this practice. The law permits the government to pass a provisional law to impose mandatory mediation when strikes threaten key sectors in the economy, and the government did so once during the year to prohibit a strike by nurses and academically trained employees, in particular veterinarians.</p>
<p>The government effectively enforced the law. Penalties for violations, damages and fines, were sufficient to deter violations.</p>
<p>The government and employers respected freedom of association and the right to bargain collectively. Collective bargaining agreements covered nearly 100 percent of the formal economy’s workforce. Independent contractors in various industries, but mainly in construction and tourism, sometimes hired subcontractors to avoid hiring workers with bargaining rights.</p>

<h2>b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor.</p>
<p>Authorities in the Directorate of Labor and the Directorate of Immigration effectively enforced the law. Resources were adequate during the year, although there were no prosecutions. The law is sufficiently stringent compared with other serious crimes and stipulates that violations are punishable by imprisonment for up to 12 years. There was no information on any victims of labor trafficking removed from forced labor during the year.</p>
<p>There were claims employers subjected men and women to forced labor in massage parlors, restaurants, construction, and fish factories, and as au pairs in private houses. One source claimed that traffickers subjected women to domestic servitude and sex trafficking through forced marriages.</p>

<h2>c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>According to the law, children who are 13 and 14 years of age may be employed in light work up to 12 hours per week and a maximum of two hours per day outside organized school teaching hours during the school year, and up to 35 hours a week or a maximum of seven hours per day during school vacations. They may not work between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. Children between the ages of 15 and 18 who do not attend school may work up to 40 hours per week and a maximum of eight hours per day, but not between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. For children who remain in school, the law limits work to 12 hours per week and a maximum two hours per day during the school year, but up to 40 hours per week and a maximum eight hours per day during school vacations. They may not work between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. Children under 18 may not be employed in work under the following conditions: work that it is likely to be beyond their physical or mental capacity; work that is likely to cause permanent damage to health; work that involves the risk of hazardous radiation; work involving a risk of accidents which it can be assumed that children and teenagers could have difficulty in identifying or avoiding due to their lack of awareness or lack of experience or training; or work where there is a risk of violence or other specific risk, except where the young persons work with adults. The government generally enforced the law. There were no known cases of child labor.</p>
<p>The Administration of Occupational Safety and Health (AOSH) enforced child labor laws and regulations with effective inspections and penalties, which can range from fines to prison sentences.</p>

<h2>d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>Labor laws and regulations do not specifically prohibit discrimination regarding race, color, religion, political opinion, national origin, citizenship, social origin, disability, language, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, HIV positive status or other communicable diseases. Nevertheless, the constitution and other laws ban such discrimination in general and establish fines for violations. The government effectively enforced the law.</p>
<p>The Center for Gender Equality reported that many more men than women were in managerial positions. Anecdotal evidence suggested some employers might without reason limit their hiring to native Icelandic-speaking individuals. Disability rights advocates asserted that persons with disabilities had a more difficult time finding jobs due to prejudice and that fewer job opportunities, especially part-time, were available for persons with disabilities. The positions that persons with disabilities were able to find were usually low paying, required only a low level of education or skills, and offered limited opportunities for advancement.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section7eacceptable">
<a class="goto" name="section7eacceptable"></a>
<h2>e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law does not establish a minimum wage. The minimum wages negotiated in various collective bargaining agreements applied automatically to all employees in those occupations, including foreign workers, regardless of union membership. While the agreements can be either industry-wide, sector-wide, or in some cases firm-specific, the type of position defined the negotiated wage levels.</p>
<p>The standard legal workweek is 40 hours and paid annual holidays include 14 whole days and two half-days. The law requires that employers must compensate work exceeding eight hours per day as overtime. Overtime pay does not vary significantly across unions, but collective bargaining agreements determine the terms of overtime pay. The law limits the total hours a worker may work, including overtime, to 48 hours a week on average during each four-month period. The law entitles workers to 11 hours of rest in each 24-hour period and one day off each week. Under special defined circumstances, employers may reduce the 11-hour rest period to no fewer than eight hours, but they must then compensate workers with corresponding rest time later. They may also postpone a worker’s day off, but the worker must receive the corresponding rest time within 14 days. The AOSH monitored and enforced these regulations.</p>
<p>The law sets occupational health and safety standards, which are current and appropriate for the main industries, and the Ministry of Welfare administered and enforced them through the AOSH, which conducted both proactive and reactive inspections. The ministry can close workplaces that fail to meet safety and health standards, and, as of December 18, temporarily prohibited certain tasks in workplaces in 48 instances. Workers could remove themselves from situations that endangered health or safety without jeopardy to their employment.</p>
<p>The AOSH did not employ a sufficient number of inspectors to enforce standards effectively in all sectors. The AOSH levied daily fines on companies that did not follow instructions urging them to improve work conditions. Daily fines were generally sufficient to deter violations. The AOSH strengthened its systematic inspection of land-based fish processing, and launched a formal interagency effort to guarantee coordinated enforcement actions against violators of labor law and occupational health and safety standards. The government provided universal healthcare coverage to all workers, including those in the informal economy.</p>
<p>Violations of wage and overtime standards were most common in the restaurant and hospitality sectors. The Icelandic Federation of Labor stated that workers in the tourism, restaurant and hospitality industries, as well as foreign workers, primarily men in heavy industry and the construction industry, some of them undocumented, were paid less than the negotiated minimum wage. Although violations of occupational safety and health standards occurred in all sectors, violations occurred most frequently in the construction and food industry. Young workers and employees who did not understand or speak Icelandic and did not know local rules and regulations were more likely to be subject to hazardous or exploitative working conditions.</p>
