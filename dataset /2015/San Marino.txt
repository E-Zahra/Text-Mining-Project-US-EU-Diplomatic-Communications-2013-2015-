<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>The Republic of San Marino is a multiparty democracy. The popularly elected, unicameral Great and General Council (parliament) selects two of its members to serve as captains regent (co-heads of state). They preside over meetings of the council and the Congress of State (cabinet), which has no more than 10 other members (secretaries of state), selected by the council. Observers considered the 2012 parliamentary elections to have been free and fair. Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.</p>
<p>There were no reports of egregious human rights abuses.</p>
<p>There were some charges of corruption on the part of officials and politicians. Not all public buildings were accessible to persons with physical disabilities. Authorities did not always enforce government health and safety standards in the informal labor sector.</p>
<p>The government took steps to investigate and punish officials accused of abuses.</p>

<h2>a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1bdisappearance">
<a class="goto" name="section1bdisappearance"></a>
<h2>b. Disappearance</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1ctorture">
<a class="goto" name="section1ctorture"></a>
<h2>c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that government officials employed them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1prisonand">
<a class="goto" name="section1prisonand"></a>
<h2>Prison and Detention Center Conditions</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>Prison and detention center conditions generally met international standards.</p>
<p><u>Physical Conditions</u>: There were no reports of deaths in prison or other detention facilities during the first nine months of the year.</p>
<p><u>Administration</u>: The country does not have a dedicated ombudsman for detained persons. The two Captains Regent (Heads of State) may receive petitions from citizens regarding any activities of government bodies.</p>
<p><u>Independent Monitoring</u>: The government permitted visits by independent nongovernmental observers and international bodies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1darbitrary">
<a class="goto" name="section1darbitrary"></a>
<h2>d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observed these prohibitions.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Role of the Police and Security Apparatus</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The Civil Police operate under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The captains regent control the gendarmerie and National Guard (military corps) when they are performing duties related to public order and security; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs exercises control over such administrative functions as personnel and equipment, and the court exercises control over the gendarmerie when it acts as judicial police. The Military Congress enforces military discipline.</p>
<p>Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the Civil Police, the gendarmerie, and the National Guard, and the government had effective mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption. The commissario della legge (commissioner of the law) investigated and prosecuted criminal activity in the country, including any killings by security forces. There were no reports of impunity involving the security forces.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>Warrants based on sufficient evidence and issued by a duly authorized official are required for authorities to apprehend persons other than those whom they caught and arrested during the commission of an alleged crime. The law provides a detainee with the right to a judicial determination of the legality of the detention, and authorities generally respected this right. Police promptly informed detainees of charges against them. There was a well-functioning bail system. Authorities provided detainees quick access to family members and a lawyer of their choice. The state provided legal assistance to indigent persons, and there were no reports of limitations to this provision. There were no reports that authorities detained or held persons incommunicado or placed them under house arrest.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-section section1edenial">
<a class="goto" name="section1edenial"></a>
<h2>e. Denial of Fair Public Trial</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected judicial independence.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Trial Procedures</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. The law provides for the presumption of innocence and requires authorities to inform defendants promptly and in detail of the charges against them. Defendants have the right to a fair, public trial without undue delay. There is no trial by jury; a single judge presides over trials. Defendants have the right to be present at trial and to consult an attorney of their choice, including during preliminary investigations. Indigent defendants have the right to an attorney provided at public expense. Defendants have the right to adequate time to prepare a defense. Defendants may access government-held evidence relevant to their cases, question witnesses against them, and present witnesses and evidence on their behalf. Authorities may not compel defendants to testify or to confess guilt. Defendants have the right to two levels of appeal. The law extends these rights to all citizens.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Political Prisoners and Detainees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Civil Judicial Procedures and Remedies</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>Individuals may seek civil remedies for human rights violations through domestic courts. Administrative as well as judicial remedies exist for alleged wrongs, including human rights violations. Citizens may appeal cases involving alleged violations by the state of the European Convention on Human Rights to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after they have exhausted all routes for appeal in the domestic courts.</p>

<a class="goto" name="section1farbitrary"></a>
<h2>f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law prohibits such actions, but there was a report that the government failed to respect these prohibitions in one instance. During the year the ECHR held that the government failed to protect adequately four Italian citizens from the unlawful search and seizure of their financial records, an action it regarded as a violation of the country’s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<h2>a. Freedom of Speech and Press</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respected these rights. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combined to promote freedom of speech and press.</p>
<p><u>Freedom of Speech and Expression</u>: The country’s laws prohibit persons from disseminating, by any means, ideas based on racial superiority or on racial or ethnic hatred, or from committing or encouraging others to commit discriminatory acts on the grounds of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or sexual orientation. There were no reports of prosecution based on these laws.</p>
<p><u>Press and Media Freedoms</u>: A 2014 law regulating the media and the work of media professionals provides for an Authority for Information (Authority Garante per l’Informazione), which may impose sanctions (including fines) on journalists and media who violate a national media code of conduct. There is no appeal procedure for those convicted. The parliament appointed the five members of the authority on June 29. The Code of Conduct itself was not published as of December 1, and the authority took no actions against media in the first 11 months of the year, but some observers were critical. In an October 15 report on his visit to the country earlier in the year, the commissioner for human rights of the Council of Europe stated that the enforcement mechanism carried a risk of undue influence over media content.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Internet Freedom</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p>The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the internet or censor online content, and there were no reports the government monitored private online communications without appropriate legal authority. According to the International Telecommunication Union, 53 percent of the population used the internet in 2014.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Academic Freedom and Cultural Events</h3>

<h2>d. Freedom of Movement, Internally Displaced Persons, Protection of Refugees, and Stateless Persons</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>The law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government generally respected these rights. The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in providing protection and assistance to refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons, and other persons of concern. Cooperation was limited; the country has not ratified the Geneva Convention related to the Status of Refugees.</p>
<div class="sub-sub-section"><h3>Protection of Refugees</h3>
<div class="sub-sub-section_content">
<p><u>Access to Asylum</u>: The law provides for the granting of asylum or refugee status, and the government has established a system for providing protection to refugees. The government provided protection against the expulsion or return of refugees to countries where their lives or freedom would be in danger. The government may grant refugee status or asylum by an act of the cabinet.</p>

<div class="section_content"><div class="section-content-intro"><p>The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by officials, and the government generally implemented the law effectively.</p>
<p><u>Corruption</u>: On October 17, authorities arrested Gabriele Gatti, who served multiple times as foreign affairs minister, on charges of criminal association, corruption, vote buying, and bribery. On October 19, San Marino Federal Court began a trial involving a number of politicians charged with using a dedicated bank account to withdraw money that allegedly came from and was used for illegal activities.</p>
<p><u>Financial Disclosure</u>: There is no specific financial disclosure requirement for public officials. The law requires all candidates running for an elected office to disclose their income from the previous year as well as any assets or investments in companies.</p>
<p><u>Public Access to Information</u>: The law provides for public access to government information, and the government effectively implemented the law by providing such information to the public through the Ministry of Interior’s website, the parliament’s website, and the official bulletin’s website.</p>

<p>The government enforced applicable laws without lengthy delays and appeals. Information regarding the adequacy of resources, inspections, remediation efforts, judicial and administrative procedures, and penalties for violations was not available.</p>
<p>The government generally respected freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. Worker organizations were independent of the government and political parties.

<h2>d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment or Occupation</h2>

<h2>e. Acceptable Conditions of Work</h2>
<div class="sub-section_content">
<p>There is no national minimum wage. Industry-based minimum wages existed for various industrial sectors. The minimum wage for a lowest-category worker in the services sector (lowest paid category) was 9.84 euros ($10.82). While there was no official estimate of the poverty income level, individuals with annual incomes below 8,500 euros ($9,350) could apply for a state contribution, which varied depending on the level of poverty. On average, less than 2 percent of the adult population applied for this contribution annually.</p>
<p>The law sets the workweek at 36 hours in the public sector and 37.5 hours for industry and private businesses, with 24 consecutive hours of rest per week mandated for workers in both categories. The law provides for paid annual holidays and leave, requires a premium payment for overtime, and allows a maximum of two hours of overtime per day. The law prohibits excessive or compulsory overtime. The government set safety and health standards.</p>
<p>The government generally enforced labor standards well. There were a few exceptions, especially in the construction and mechanic industries, where some employers did not consistently abide by safety regulations, such as workhour limitations and use of personal safety devices. Authorities did not enforce health and safety standards in the informal sector. There were no reports of serious injuries to workers in the first nine months of the year. The penalties provided by law range from a fine to imprisonment for a second-degree crime and were generally sufficient to deter violations. The Labor Office has responsibility for receiving and investigating claims of workplace health and safety violations. Workers could remove themselves from situations that endangered health or safety without jeopardy to their employment. The government effectively protected employees in this situation.</p>
